Car Cast Resurrected is built to be a simple Android podcast app that does podcasts the way I want them:
Download the latest episodes and allow me to play or skip through them in an easy-to-control way in the car.
It is not meant to tie you to the internet, where coverage can be spotty, and it will not help you "discover" podcasts.
It will not bother you with ads.

Features

  * large buttons (typical for automotive use)
  * large text
  * remembers last played location for each podcast episode
  * uses offline downloads 
  
This project is a resurrected version of https://github.com/bherrmann7/Car-Cast, which has become more and more buggy on newer phones.
It removes "extra" functionality of the original:
  * Audio note taker
  * Remote control
